    <h2>What are Crepes?</h2>
    <p>Crepes are a thin pancake that originated in the Brittany region of France during the 13th century.
        Crepes come in one of two varieties: sweet or savory. They usually come with a filling which
        is determined by the type of crepe one is having.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter (86g)</li>
            <li>1 cup (125g) flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (180ml) milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (120ml) water</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt 3 tablespoons of butter. Set the other half aside to be
                used in the skillet later.
            </li>
            <li>Combine the melted butter, flour, sugar, salt, milk, water, eggs,
                and vanilla and mix until combined. The mixture should be smooth and creamy.
                Cover the mixture, and let chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes
                or up to 1 day.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cooking the crepes:</strong>Use the remaining butter to grease the
            pan/skillet between each crepe. Place your skillet over medium heat, and grease.
            Once the skillet is hot, pour 3-4 tablespoons of batter into the center. Move the
            skillet around until the batter is stretched thin, the thinner the better. Cook for
            1-2 minutes or until the bottom is set. Once flipped cook the other side for 30 seconds.
            Transfer the crepe to a plate, and repeat the steps.</li>
            <li>Fill the crepe with the ingredient of your choice.</li>
            <li>Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 1 day
                or up to 1 month in the freezer.
            </li>
        </ol>
